To update the `App.jsx` file so that the top banner has a background color of `#333` and the text is white, you can use Tailwind CSS classes directly in your JSX code. The `bg-gray-800` class in Tailwind closely matches the `#333` color, and `text-white` will make the text white. 

Here's how you can update your `App.jsx` component:

```jsx
// App.jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="topbar bg-gray-800 text-white py-4">
        <h1 className="text-center text-2xl">My Application</h1>
      </header>
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
- `bg-gray-800`: This Tailwind CSS class sets the background color to a shade that's close to `#333`.
- `text-white`: This class sets the text color to white.
- `py-4`: This class adds vertical padding to the header for some space around the content.

Additionally, if you still need the `.topbar` class for any custom styling in `index.css`, you can keep it there without specifying the background color or text color again, as those are now being managed by Tailwind CSS like so:

```css
/* index.css */
.topbar {
  /* Any additional custom styles for topbar can go here */
}
```

These changes will ensure that your banner is styled correctly with Tailwind CSS without needing additional CSS definitions unless further customization is needed.
