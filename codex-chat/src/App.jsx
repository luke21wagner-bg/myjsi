To make the top banner of your app a slightly less grey color, you'll want to update the CSS styles for the banner. Assuming you have a CSS class or ID that targets the top banner, you can adjust the color code to a lighter shade of grey.

Here's an example of how you might update it:

```css
/* Original CSS */
.top-banner {
    background-color: #888888; /* Original grey color */
}

/* Updated CSS for a slightly less grey color */
.top-banner {
    background-color: #bbbbbb; /* Lighter shade of grey */
}
```

If you are using inline styles or a style-in-JS solution (like styled-components or CSS-in-JS), you would update the background color in a similar fashion within your React component.

Here's an example using inline styles:

```jsx
// Original inline style
<div style={{ backgroundColor: '#888888' }} className="top-banner"> 
    {/* Banner content */}
</div>

// Updated inline style
<div style={{ backgroundColor: '#bbbbbb' }} className="top-banner">
    {/* Banner content */}
</div>
```

Make sure to choose a shade that suits your app's design aesthetics. If youâ€™re using a different method or library for styling, let me know, and I can provide an example tailored to that approach.
